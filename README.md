# Housing-Price-Estimation
A ML Model showing gradient descent and predicting housing prices.
Libraries Used: Matplotlib, numpy, pandas, sklearn, math.
This project determines predicts the prices of housing by learning from a given set of data. The project was made on Jupyter Notebook. There are histograms and graph in the file, which will be easier to access on Jupyter NB.
